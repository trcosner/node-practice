# Node.js Practice

This repository contains a collection of small, self-contained Node.js projects created for practice and experimentation.

Each project lives in its own directory and includes everything needed to run and test it.

Projects may cover various Node.js features, such as core modules, Express, multithreading, or other backend concepts.
